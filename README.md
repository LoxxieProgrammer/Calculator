# Calculator
As someone who is already familiar with C#, learning to write Java code was a fairly straightforward process. Both languages are object-oriented and have similar syntax, so much of the basic structure of the code was familiar to me.

After going through a number of iterations, I decided to use the Scanner class with some helper methods to handle incorrect inputs from the user.

The Scanner class is useful because it allows the program to read input from a variety of sources, such as the keyboard or a file. This makes it a versatile tool for input handling.

The calculator program also uses two helper methods: getNumber and getOperator. These methods use a loop to read the input from the user, and keep asking for a new input if an invalid value is entered.

I did momentarily forget to account for dividing by zero but I have a partner who is very good at finding problems with my code (She actively tries to break them) so it did not take me long to add that to the code as well.

Overall, the process of learning to write Java code was relatively smooth for me, as I was able to apply my knowledge of C# to the new language. With a little bit of practice and some reference to the Java documentation, I was able to write Java programs that were similar to those that I had written in C#.
